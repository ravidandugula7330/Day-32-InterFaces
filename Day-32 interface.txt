Day-32 interface

Interfaces:

Definition: 
1.	specifications to a set of classes.
2.	any service requirement specification is called as an interface(SRS).
3.	Contract between client and service provider is called as an interface.
4.	inside interface every method is always abstract whether we are declaring or not. Hence interface is considered as 100% pure abstract class.
100 % pure abstract class method

Summary Definition:

Specification to set of classes or any service requirement specification or contact between client and service provider or 100% pure abstract classes is considered as an interface.

Declaration and implementation of an interface:

Declaration:

interface interface-name{
abstract methods;
variables;
}

// every method is always public and abstract by default.
// every variable is public, static and final by default.

Interface Implementation:

public class class-name implements interface-name {
// provide implementation all abstract methods.
// optional-- non-abstract methods.

}

extends vs implements:

1.	a class can extends only one class at a time.
2.	a class can implement any no of interfaces at a time.

Example:
public interface One{
}
public interface Two{
}
class Hello implements One, Two{
}

3. a class can extends a class and can implement any no.of interfaces at a time.

Example:

public class A{
}
interface B{
}
interface C{
}
public class D extends A implements B,C{
}

4. an interface can extends any no of interfaces at time.

interface X{
}
interface Y{
}
interface Z{
}
interface A extends X,Y,Z{
}



Which of the following is true?

1.	A class can extends any no of classes at a time.
2.	An interface can extend only one interface at a time.
3.	A class can implement only one interface at a time.
4.	A class can extend a class and can implement an interface but not both simultaneously.
5.	An interface can implement any no of interfaces at a time.
6.	None of the above.
